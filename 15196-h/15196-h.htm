    <h2>WHY I DON'T WRITE PLAYS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>From the Common-place Book of a Novelist.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Because it is so much pleasanter to read one's work than to
    hear it on the Stage.</p>

    <p>Because Publishers are far more amiable to deal with than
    Actor-Managers.</p>

    <p>Because "behind the scenes" is such a disappointing
    place&mdash;except in Novels.</p>

    <p>Because why waste three weeks on writing a Play, when it
    takes only three years to compose a Novel?</p>

    <p>Because Critics who send articles to Magazines inviting one
    to contribute to the Stage, have no right to dictate to us.</p>

    <p>Because a fairly successful Novel means five hundred pounds,
    and a fairly successful Play yields as many thousands&mdash;why
    be influenced by mercenary motives?</p>

    <p>Because all Novelists hire their pens in advance for years,
    and have no time left for outside labour.</p>

    <p>And last, and (perhaps) not least, Why don't I send in a
    Play? Because I <i>have</i> tried to write <i>one</i>, and find
    I can't quite manage it!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>According to recent accounts, the attitude of the Salvation
    Army in Canada may be fairly described as "Revolting."</p>

        <h3>EQUIVOCAL.</h3>

        <p><i>Rising Young Physician</i> (<i>who cured so many
        Patients in last year's Epidemic</i>). "NOT MUCH CHANCE OF
        MORE INFLUENZA IN ENGLAND <i>THIS</i> WINTER, I FANCY!"</p>

        <p><i>His Wife.</i> "LET US HOPE FOR THE BEST,
        DEAREST!"</p>
    </div>
    <hr />

    <h2>A DIARY OF THE DEAD SEASON.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Suggested by the Contents Bills.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;First appearance of "the Epidemic."
    Good bold line with reference to Russia. Not of sufficient
    importance to head the Bill, but still distinctly taking.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Quite a feature. Centre of the Bill
    with sub-lines of "Horrible Disclosures," and "Painful Scenes."
    Becoming a boom. To be further developed to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Bill all "Epidemic." Even Cricket
    sacrificed to make room for it. "News from Abroad." "Horrors at
    Hamburg." No idea it would turn out so well. A perfect
    treasure-trove at this quiet season of the year!</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Nothing but "Epidemic"&mdash;"Arrival
    in England"&mdash;"Precautions Everywhere." Let the boom go! It
    feeds itself! Nearly as good as a foreign war!</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Still "the Epidemic," but requires
    strengthening. "Spreading in the Provinces," but still, not
    like it was. Falling flat.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;A good sensational Murder! The very
    thing for the Contents Bills. Exit "the Epidemic," until again
    wanted.</p>
    <hr />

        <p>["Smoothly written <i>vers de Société</i>, where a

    <h3>UN-BROCKEN VOWS.</h3>

    <p>Walpurgis Brocken Night at Crystal Palace last
    Thursday&mdash;Grand! Jupiter Pluvius suspended buckets, and
    celestial water-works rested awhile to make way for Terrestrial
    Fire-works. "Todgers's can do it when it likes," as all
    Martin-Chuzzlewiters know, and BROCK can do it too when
    <i>he</i> likes. <i>À propos</i> of DICKENS' quotation above,
    it is on record that <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> was once addressed as
    "Old Fireworks." Where? When? and How? <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>, we
    are led to infer by the commentary thereon, somewhat objected
    to the term, unless our Pickwickian memory fail us&mdash;which
    is not improbable&mdash;but Mr. BROCK would appropriate it to
    himself with pleasure, and be "'proud o' the title' as the
    Living Skeleton said." Despite wind and weather, and
    <i>contretemps</i> generally, BROCK has never brocken faith
    with the public. "<i>Facta non verba</i>" is his motto: and
    "<i>Facta</i>" means (here) Fire-works.</p>

        Most entertaining, I'm sure! (<i>He coos.</i>) What
        wonderful ingenuity one sees in devising ever-fresh
        pastimes, do we not? Indeed, yes!</p>

        <p><i>Miss Stella</i>. There, I've shuffled all the animals
        now. (<i>Presenting the hat</i>.) Mr. HEADNOTE, will you
        draw first?</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i>. Oh, really. Am I to take one of
        these? Charmed! (<i>He draws.</i>) Now I wonder what my
        fate&mdash;(<i>Opening the paper</i>.) The Monkey! (<i>His
        face falls.</i>) <i>Is</i> there a Monkey here? <i>Dear</i>
        me, how <i>very</i> interesting!</p>

        <p><i>Dick Gatling</i> (<i>of H.M. Gunboat</i>
        "<i>Weasel</i>"). Brought him over my last cruise from
        Colombo. No end of a jolly little beast&mdash;bites like
        the&mdash;like <i>blazes</i>, you know!</p>

        <p><i>Miss Stella</i> (<i>to her Cousin</i>). Now, DICK, I
        won't have you taking away poor Jacko's character like
        that. He's only bitten BINNS&mdash;and, well, there
        <i>was</i> the gardener's boy&mdash;but I'm sure he
        <i>teased</i> him. <i>You</i> won't tease him, will you,
        Mr. HEADNOTE?</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i>. I&mdash;I shouldn't dream of it, Miss
        STELLA,&mdash;on the contrary, I&mdash;(<i>To himself</i>.)
        Was it quite discreet to let myself be drawn into this?
        Shall I not risk lowering my office by publicly associating
        myself with a&mdash;a Monkey? I feel certain the Vicar
        would disapprove strongly.</p>

        <p><i>Dick</i> (<i>to</i> Colonel KEMPTON). Drawn
        <i>your</i> animal yet, Sir?</p>

        <p><i>The Colonel</i> (<i>heatedly</i>). Yes, I
        have&mdash;and I wish I'd kept out of this infernal
        tomfoolery. Why the mischief don't they leave a man in
        peace and quietness on a hot afternoon like this? Here am
        I, routed out of a comfortable seat to go and drive a
        confounded White Rabbit, Sir! Idiotic, <i>I</i> call
        it!</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i>. Pardon me, Colonel KEMPTON; but if
        you object to the Rabbit, I would not at all mind
        undertaking it myself&mdash;and you could take my
        Monkey&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>The Colonel</i>. Thanks&mdash;but I won't deprive
        you. A Rabbit is quite responsibility enough for me!</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i> (<i>to himself, disappointed</i>).
        He's afraid of a poor harmless Monkey&mdash;and he an Army
        man, too! But I <i>don't</i> see why <i>I</i>&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Miss Gussie Grissell</i>. Oh, Mr. HEADNOTE,
        <i>isn't</i> it ridiculous! They've given me a Kitten! It
        makes me feel too absurdly young!</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). If you would prefer
        a&mdash;a more appropriate animal, there's a Monkey, which
        I am sure&mdash;(<i>To himself, as</i> Miss G. <i>turns
        away indignantly</i>). This Monkey doesn't seem very
        popular&mdash;there must be <i>someone</i> here
        who&mdash;I'll try the American Lady&mdash;they are
        generally eccentric. (<i>To</i> Mrs. HEBER K. BANGS.) I
        hope Fortune has been kind to you, Mrs. BANGS?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Bangs</i>. Well, I don't know; there <i>are</i>
        quadrupeds that can trot faster over the measured mile than
        a Tortoise, and that's <i>my</i> animal.</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i> (<i>with sympathy</i>). Dear me! That
        is a trial, indeed, for you! But if you would prefer
        something rather more exciting, I should be most happy, I'm
        sure, to exchange my Monkey&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Dick Gatling</i> (<i>bustling up</i>). Hallo, what's
        that? No, no, Mrs. BANGS&mdash;be true to your Tortoise. I
        tell you he's going to romp in&mdash;Æsop's tip, don't you
        know? I've backed you to win or a place. I say, what do you
        think <i>I</i>'ve drawn&mdash;the Mutton! Just my luck!</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i>. DICK, just come this way a
        moment&mdash;I've a proposition to make; it's occurred to
        me that the Monkey would feel more&mdash;more at home with
        you, and, in short, I&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Plumley Duff</i> (<i>plaintively, to</i> Miss
        CYNTHIA CHAFFERS). I shouldn't have minded any other
        animal&mdash;but to be paired off with a Goose!</p>

        <p><i>Miss Chaffers</i> (<i>consolingly</i>). You're better
        off than <i>I</i> am, at all events&mdash;I've got a
        Puppy!</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Duff</i>. Have you? (<i>After a
        pause&mdash;sentimentally</i>.) Happy Puppy!</p>

        <p><i>Miss C.</i> He'll be anything but a happy Puppy if he
        doesn't win.</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Duff</i>. Oh, but he's sure to. I know I would,
        if <i>I</i> was your Puppy!</p>

        <p><i>Miss C.</i> I'm not so sure of that. Don't they lodge
        objections, or something, for boring?</p>

        <p><i>Mr. Fanshawe</i>. Can anybody inform me whether I'm
        expected to go and catch my Peacock? Because I'll be hanged
        if&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>The Curate</i>. Oh, Miss STELLA, it's all
        right&mdash;Mr. GATLING thinks that it would be better if
        he undertook the Monkey himself; so we've arranged
        to&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Miss Stella</i>. Oh, nonsense, DICK! I can't have you
        taking advantage of Mr. HEADNOTE's good-nature like that.
        What's the use of drawing lots at all if you don't keep to
        them? Of <i>course</i> Mr. HEADNOTE will keep the
        Monkey.</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Once more I am back in my London
    "<i>pied-à-terre</i>"&mdash;(but how it can he a
    <i>pied-à-TERRE</i>, I don't quite know, considering it's a
    flat on the fourth floor!&mdash;<i>ridiculous</i> language
    French is to be sure!)&mdash;and</p>

    <p>very glad to get home again I assure you. I have spent the
    last few weeks in the Isle of Wight, which is a British
    Possession in the latitude of Spithead&mdash;(I don't know why
    Spithead should want any latitude, but it seems to take a good
    deal!)&mdash;sacred to Tourists, <i>Char-à-bancs</i>, and
    Pirates&mdash;the latter disguised as Lodging-letters!</p>

    <p>While there we suffered severely from Regattas; which swarm
    in the Island at this season, and are hotly pursued by the
    visitors, with the deadly telescope. I myself was bitten once
    by the Regatta Bacteria, and very painful it was. My friend,
    Baron VON HODGEMANN, owner of the <i>Anglesey</i>, persuaded me
    to go on board for a race, and we travelled the whole thirty
    miles sitting at an angle of forty-five degrees, and singing
    the war-cry of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club!&mdash;</p>

    and, though few of the "smart" Ladies of my set habitually
    indulge in the habit. I am happy to think I am encouraging them

    time even rival Lawn Tennis! However&mdash;not to beat about

    is!&mdash;as if it could hurt the bush to beat it!&mdash;to say

    of mine was&mdash;<i>I went paddling!</i> There!&mdash;the
    secret is out!&mdash;the Fashion is set!&mdash;the new Summer
    Amusement discovered! The Rules of the Game are being written,
    and will shortly be published under the title, "<i>Routledge's
    Etiquette of Paddling, for Ladies of Good Standing</i>." I need
    hardly tell you that the first thing necessary is to find a
    secluded bay, and it is also advisable to collect a few
    children to take with you&mdash;(there are usually plenty left
    about on the beach from which you can make a
    selection)&mdash;as a sort of excuse;&mdash;no other implements
    are required for the game, in fact, superfluities are a
    nuisance and only get wet&mdash;thus equipped&mdash;the game
    can be played with freedom&mdash;(<i>not</i> from
    pebbles)&mdash;combined of course with propriety, and will be
    found amusing and invigorating&mdash;(quotation from the

    Doncaster this week, and the most important race, I take
    it&mdash;at least, <i>I</i> don't take it&mdash;but the

    <h2>STUDIES IN THE NEW POETRY.</h2>

    <h3>No. V.</h3>

    <p>It may be objected that <i>Mr. Punch's</i> fifth example
    does not strictly conform to the canons laid down by him in his
    prefatory remarks to No. I. <i>Mr. Punch</i> neither admits nor
    denies the charge. He is convinced, however, that those who do
    him the honour to read these Studies, might justly complain if
    he failed to include in them an example of the work of a Poet
    who has shown our generation how rusticity and rhymes, cattle
    and Conservative convictions, peasants and patriotism, may be
    combined in verse. It is scarcely necessary to add that the
    author of the following magnificent piece is Mr. A-FR-D A-ST-N.
    Like others who might be named, he has not the honour to be an
    agricultural labourer; but no living man has sung at greater
    length of rural life, and its simple joys. Many of his admirers
    have asserted that Britain ought to have more than one
    Laureate, and that Mr. A-FR-D A-ST-N ought to be among the
    number. Others are not prepared to go quite so far. They have
    been heard to complain that cows and trees, and woodmen and
    farms, and sheep and wains, and hay and turnips, do not
    necessarily suggest the highest happiness, and that it is not
    always dignified for an aspiring Poet to be led about helpless
    through the byeways of sense by those wilful, wanton
    playfellows, his rhymes. The two factions may be left to fight
    out their quarrel over the present example, which, by the way,
    is <i>not</i> taken from the collected edition of the Poet's
    works.</p>

    <h2>A NIGHTLY CHEVALIER.</h2>

    <p>Music-Hall Artists are not by any means "Fixed Stars."
    During the evening they manage to accomplish the somewhat
    paradoxical-sounding feat of shining in the same parts, yet in
    different places and at different times, appearing everywhere
    with undiminished brilliancy. The Student of the Music-Hall
    Planetary system, has only by observation to ascertain the
    exact time and place of the appearance of his favourite bright
    particular Star, and then to pay his money, take his choice
    between sitting and standing, and like a true astronomer, he
    will&mdash;glass in hand, a strong glass too,&mdash;await the
    great event of the evening, calmly and contentedly.</p>

    <p>If the Wirtuous Westender wandering down the Strand, after
    having on some previous nights exhausted the Pavilion and the
    elaborately gorgeous Variety Shows given at the Empire and
    Alhambra, seeks for awhile a resting-place wherein to enjoy his
    postprandial cigar, and be amused, if such an one will drop
    into the classic Tivoli, he will find excellent entertainment,
    that is as long as their present programme holds the field. The
    Holborn and the Oxford may delight him on other nights, for it
    seems that much the same Stars shine all around; but for the
    present, taking Tivoli as synonymous with Tibur, he may, with
    Horation humour, say to himself ("himself" being not a bad
    audience as a rule):&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Holborn Tibur amem ventosus, Tivoli Holborn,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and he can then enter the Tivoli, now under the benign rule
    of that old Music Hall Hand, CAROLUS MORTONIUS, M.A., Magister
    Agens, while the experienced Mr. VERNON
    DOWSETT&mdash;"<i>Experientia Dowsett</i>"&mdash;manages the
    stage. Good as is the entire show, and especially good as is
    the performance of Mr. CHARLES GODFREY as an old Chelsea
    Pensioner recounting to several little Peterkins a touching and
    heart-stirring tale of the Crimean War, yet for me, the
    Costermonger Songs of Mr. ALBERT CHEVALIER are the great
    attraction. His now well-known "<i>Coster's Serenade</i>," and
    his "<i>Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road</i>," are supplemented
    by a song and dialogue about a Coster's son, a precocious
    little chap, about three years old, and "only that 'igh, you
    know," in whom his father takes so great a pride that it works
    his own temporary reformation. It is so natural as to be just
    on the borderland between farce and pathos, and recalls time
    past, when ROBSON played <i>The Porter's Knot</i>, and
    such-like pieces. Now what more do Music Halls want than what
    Mr. CHEVALIER gives them? This is the very essence of a
    dramatic sketch of character, given in just the time it takes
    to sing the song,&mdash;that is, about ten minutes, if as much.
    The compact orchestra, under the directorship of Mr. ASHER,
    discourses excellent accompaniments, and the music of the
    CHEVALIER's songs&mdash;composed, I believe, by
    himself&mdash;is not the least among the attractions. The
    CHEVALIER, who, as he takes more than one turn every evening,
    may be termed a Knight Errant, is certainly the Coster's
    Laureate and accepted Representative in the West; the mine,
    which is his own, is inexhaustible. He is a magician in his own
    peculiar line, and may write himself ALBERTUS MAGNUS.</p>

    <h2>THE POOR VIOLINIST.&mdash;An Episode, in the Style of
    Sterne.</h2>

    <p>"<i>Le Luthier de Crémone</i>," observed EUGENIUS, "is a
    pathetic story."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, EUGENIUS," replied YORICK, "it is extremely
    touching. I protest I never read, or hear it, without
    emotion."</p>

    <p>"The violin," pursued EUGENIUS, "most sensitive, and, as it
    were, soulful of human instruments, lends itself, with
    particular aptness, to the purposes of literary pathos."</p>

    <p>"Dear Sensibility!" said I, "source inexhausted of all that
    is precious in our (poetical) joys, or costly in our (dramatic)
    sorrows!"</p>

    <p>"It were well," continued YORICK, drily, "if it were also
    the source inexhausted of more that is quick in our sympathy,
    and practical in our beneficence. It is scarcely in the columns
    of the daily news-sheet that Sensibility usually seeks its
    much-sought stimulus. And yet but lately, in the corner of my
    paper, I encountered a piteous story that 'dear Sensibility'
    (had it been more romantically environed) might deliciously
    have luxuriated in. I protest 'twas as pathetic as those of
    MARIA LE FEVRE, or LA FLEUR. It was headed, "Sad Death of a
    Well-known Violinist."</p>

    <p>"Prithee, dear YORICK, let me hear it," cried EUGENIUS.</p>

    <p>"'Twas but the prosaic report of a Coroner's Inquest,"
    pursued YORICK. "Sensibility would probably have 'skipped' the
    sordid circumstance. 'FREDERICK MARTIN, aged seventy-two, a
    well-known Violinist, and Professor of Music, formerly a member
    of the orchestra of the Italian Opera at Her Majesty's and
    Covent Garden Theatres,' found life too hard for him. That is
    all. 'The deceased, a bachelor.'&mdash;Heaven help
    him!&mdash;'had of late been afflicted with deafness, which
    hindered his pursuit of his profession, and' (the witness an
    old friend feared) 'he was recently in straitened
    circumstances, but he was too proud and independent to ask or
    accept assistance.' The old friend, Mr. LEWIS CHAPUY, Comedian,
    had 'frequently offered him hospitalities, which he never
    accepted.' Offered him hospitalities! Worthy comedian! In
    faith, EUGENIUS, 'tis delicately worded. True 'Sensibility'
    here, supplemented by practical sympathy. Both, alas!
    unavailing. Somewhat of the doggedly independent spirit of the
    boot-rejecting Dr. JOHNSON in this poor deaf violinist
    apparently. Verily, EUGENIUS, the story requires but the
    'decorative art' of the literary sentimentalist to make it
    moving, even to the modish. The ingeniously emotional historian
    of LA FLEUR would have made much of it."</p>

    <p>"My gentle heart already bleeds with it," said I. "But the
    upshot, YORICK; the sequel, my friend?"</p>

    <p>"'Tis short and simple," responded YORICK. "'The afflicted
    Violinist' occupied a room at 34, Compton Street, Brunswick
    Square, in which he lived alone. He suffered from lumbago, as
    well as from a proud spirit and a broken heart. He had a dread
    of 'coming to the Workhouse.' Spectral fear which haunts ever
    the sensitive and poverty-stricken! Unreasonable? Perhaps. But
    not the less agonising. What comfort may Political Economy and
    an admirable Poor Law yield to proud-spirited victims of
    poverty?"</p>

    <p>"But surely," said I, "the compassion of the stranger would
    gladly have poured oil and wine into the wounds of his
    spirit&mdash;or into poor afflicted MARIA's&mdash;had he only
    known."</p>

    <p>"Doubtless," said YORICK. "But 'the great Sensorium of the
    World,' as&mdash;in 'mere pomp of words'&mdash;thou dost
    designate 'Dear Sensibility,' did <i>not</i> 'vibrate' to the
    case of this 'well-known Violinist'&mdash;until 'twas too late
    to vibrate to any useful purpose. He was 'found lying dead in
    his bed, fully dressed, with the exception of his hat and
    boots,' mute as the untouched strings of his own violin. 'He
    had died suddenly from syncope, or heart-failure.'
    Heart-failure, EUGENIUS. Doth not thy gentle heart fail at the
    thought? 'Dr. COLLEY found the body in an advanced stage of
    decomposition, and life had probably been extinct since the
    preceding Thursday night.' Prithee, Sir, is 'MARIA, sitting
    pensive under her poplar, more pathetic than this poor broken
    musician, dying alone, in his poverty and pride?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed, no!" I responded, musingly.</p>

    <p>"Those," continued YORICK, "who go, like the 'Knight of the
    Rueful Countenance,' in quest of melancholy adventures, need
    not to make deliberately 'Sentimental Journeys' through France,
    or Italy, or by forest or mountain, picturesque hamlet, or
    romantic stream. The purlieus of great cities amongst the
    poverty-stricken members of what it is usual to call the 'lower
    middle-classes,' will furnish multitudinous subjects for
    pensive thought, and&mdash;what were a whole world
    better&mdash;for practical benevolence. 'Tis too late, alas! to
    do aught for this dead Violinist, but were eyes and pen more
    sedulously and sympathetically employed about real, if
    sordid-seeming, in place of imaginary, if picturesque, woes,
    why verily, EUGENIUS, something more, perchance, might be done
    in such pitiful cases as that I have described to thee in
    non-journalistic language, than what was formally done by the
    Coroner's Jury, who&mdash;as they were bound to do,
    indeed&mdash;'<i>returned a verdict in accordance with the
    medical testimony</i>.'"</p>

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XIII.&mdash;TO IRRITATION.</h3>

    <p>I have just come home from my Club in a state bordering upon
    distraction. No great misfortune has happened to me, my dearest
    friend has not been black-balled, the Club bore has not had me
    in his unrelenting clutches. The waiters have been, as indeed
    they always are, civil and obliging, the excellent <i>chef</i>
    catered with his usual skill to my simple mid-day wants, my
    table companions were good-humoured, cheerful, and pleasantly
    cynical. What then, you may ask, has happened to shatter my
    nerves and impair my temper for the day? It is a simple matter,
    and I am almost ashamed to confess it openly. But I am
    encouraged by the fact that two eminently solid and, so far as
    I could see, perfectly unemotional gentlemen were as deeply
    pricked and worried by what happened as I was myself. To begin
    with, I do not admit that my nerves vibrate more easily than
    those of my fellow-men. I have never killed an organ-grinder, I
    am guiltless of the blood of a German band, I have even gone so
    far as to spare guards who asked for my railway-ticket after I
    had carefully wrapped myself up for a journey, and no touting
    vendor of subscription books or works of art can truthfully say
    that I have kicked him. On the whole I think I am reasonably
    even-tempered and of higher than average amiability. Others may
    judge me differently. I don't wish to quarrel with them. I
    simply reiterate my opinion. Why then am I to-day in a seething
    state of exception to my rule? Here is the cause:</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/120.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/120.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>After I had done with my luncheon, and had puffed a friendly
    cigar, I proceeded to that room in the Club which is specially
    dedicated to literature and silence. What a feast of
    multitudinous periodicals is there spread out, how brightly the
    variegated array of books from the circulating library attracts
    the leisurely, how dignified and awe-inspiring are the
    far-stretching ranks of accumulated volumes upon the shelves.
    And the carpet, how soft, and the chairs how comfortably easy.
    Into one of these chairs I sank with a religious novel (I
    merely mention the fact, whether for praise or blame I care
    not), and began to think deeply about various life-problems
    that have much distressed me. Why must men wear themselves out
    prematurely with labour? Why must we suffer? And why, granting
    the necessity for pain, should I occasionally sink under a
    toothache, while HARRISON, a blatant fellow with a red face and
    a loud voice, continues in a condition of robust and oppressive
    health? These speculations were not so painful and disturbing
    as might be supposed. Indeed, they had a soothing effect. From
    the rhythmical breathing and the closed eyes of two other
    occupants of arm-chairs, I judged that they were similarly
    occupied in philosophic reflection. I was just composing myself
    to a bout of specially hard thinking, when, lo, the door
    opened, and in stepped Dr. FUSSELL!</p>

    <p>Everybody, I take it, knows Dr. FUSSELL. He is a member of
    countless learned Societies. Over many of them he presides, to
    some he acts as secretary. He reads papers on abstruse
    questions connected with sanitation, he dashes with a kind of
    wild war-whoop into impassioned newspaper controversies on the
    component elements of a dust particle, or the civilisation of
    the Syro-Ph&oelig;nicians. He is acute, dialectical, scornful
    and furious. He denounces those who oppose him as the meanest
    of mankind, he extols his supporters as the most illustrious
    and reasonable of all who have benefited the human race. In the
    Club he is always engaged in some investigation which keeps him
    continuously skipping from bookshelf to bookshelf, climbing up
    ladders to reach the highest shelves, rushing up and
    down-stairs with sheaves of paper bulging in his coat-pockets,
    or stowed under his arms. He lays his top-hat on the table, and
    makes it a receptacle for reams of notes and volumes of
    projected essays. In a word, he is a human storm.</p>

    <p>Well, in he came with his grey hair streaming over his
    forehead, and his eyes aflame. I knew in a moment that repose
    in his presence was out of the question, though I still sat on,
    hoping against hope. First, the Doctor bounded to the
    fire-place, seized the poker, and began to rummage the fire. It
    was a good fire, and had done nothing to deserve this
    punishment. I shifted on my seat; the two other philosophers
    opened their eyes and frowned, and still Dr. FUSSELL continued
    to rummage. Now I knew, not only that that fire was being poked
    on an entirely wrong principle, but that I alone knew how it
    ought to be poked. My fingers itched, my whole body tingled
    with excitement. At last Dr. FUSSELL ceased. In a moment I was
    out of my seat and making a bee-line for the poker. I just
    managed to beat the other two by a short head, seized the
    poker, and relieved my soul by stirring the fire on strictly
    scientific principles. The others watched me hungrily. When I
    had finished, each of them took a short turn with the poker,
    and then we all returned, more or less appeased, to our
    seats.</p>

    <p>But we had not done with the ineffable FUSSELL. By this time
    he was on the top of a step-ladder. Slowly he selected six
    tomes, and began his perilous descent. Our eyes were riveted
    upon him. Crash, bang! His arms were empty, and the
    unconscionable books fluttered and clattered to the floor.
    Slowly and ruefully did FUSSELL descend into the cloud of dust
    and gather his bruised treasures from the carpet. At last he
    heaped them on his table, and began to write. We hoped for
    peace, but it was not to be. A sudden thought struck him. He
    would sew his scattered leaves of MS. together. With dreadful
    deliberation he took needle and cotton from a little pocket
    housewife that he carried with him; and then began one of the
    most maddening performances I have ever watched. Carefully he
    held the needle to the light, carefully he wetted and trimmed
    his cotton to a point. And for ten stricken minutes we saw him
    miss the eye of the needle, sometimes by an inch, sometimes by
    a hair's breadth. It was a thrilling contest between obstinacy
    and evasiveness. I was fascinated by it. Every time, as the
    cotton neared the eye, my heart slowly ascended into my mouth,
    only to drop with a fatal swiftness into my boots as the
    triumphant needle scored another victory. I began to imitate
    FUSSELL's every movement. I threaded invisible needles by the
    gross with imperceptible cotton. I felt in my own breast all
    the ardour of the chase, all the bitter sorrow of repeated
    failures. My two companions in misfortune were similarly
    affected, and there we sat, three sane and ordinary men,
    feverishly going through all these itching movements with
    FUSSELL as our detested, but unconscious fugleman. The strain
    became too great. I sprang from my chair, "Sir," I said to the
    astonished FUSSELL, "permit me; I learnt the art of threading
    needles as a boy from an East End seamstress," and before he
    had time to protest, I had seized the offending instruments,
    and by a stroke of inspiration had passed the cotton through.
    Then without waiting to hear what FUSSELL might have to say, I
    fled from the room. And here consequently I sit with my nerves
    shattered, and an untasted crumpet cooling on the tea-tray.</p>

    <p>Am I singular? I think not. There are others whose
    mannerisms plague me too. For instance, TRUBERRY, whom I meet
    occasionally, has a wild and venomous habit of relating to me
    his infinitesimal jokelets. That I could pardon. But when,
    having related one, he bursts, as he always does, into a
    helpless suffocation of purple laughter, the savage within me
    awakes and I murder TRUBERRY in fancy to an accompaniment of
    refined and protracted tortures. Once, as I helped him on with
    his overcoat, he joked and exploded. My fingers were horribly
    near his throat. But I mastered the impulse, and TRUBERRY will
    never know how near he was to destruction. And to make matters
    worse, he is one of the kindest and most considerately helpful
    of human beings. Oh, IRRITATION, IRRITATION, you have much to
    answer for. The fly in the ointment of the apothecary was a
    baby to you. Avaunt, avaunt!</p>

    <p>THE VERY LATEST.&mdash;Mrs. RAM had a paragraph read to her
    from the <i>D.T.'s</i> "London Day by Day," recounting how the
    Archbishop of CANTERBURY when staying at Haddo House, had
    attended service in the parish Kirk, which conduct might have
    provoked High Churchmen to assail him for "bowing the knee in
    the House of Rimmon." Thinking it over afterwards, when she had
    muddled up the name in her usual fashion, our old friend Mrs.
    R. observed, with some humour, that she thought "the Archbishop
    had shown his good scents by going to the House of RIMMEL."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
